# FFXIV-Tools-Project

A simple tool to retrieve a list of equippable items in FFXIV.

## Getting Started

To use the Python script, you can setup a virtual environment and install the necessary modules or install them directly on your machine.  

You will also need Item.csv in the same folder as the location where you are running the script.

## Installation

- Download ffxiv_item_search.py and Item.csv to any desired location in the same folder
- Run the following command **"pip install pandas"**

    Note: The ClassJobCategory.json file is not required for the script. It only contains the IDs for the jobs used in Item.csv

## Usage

Available Jobs:
Combat: ACN, ARC, AST, BLM, BRD, CNJ, DRG, DRK, GLA, LNC, MNK, MRD, NIN, PLD, ROG, SCH, SMN, THM, WAR, WHM
Categories: DoW (Disciples of War), DoM (Disciples of Magic)

Crafters/Gatherers:
Available Jobs: ALC, ARM, BSM, BTN, CRP, CUL, FSH, GSM, LTW, MIN, WVR

Available Categories: DoH (Disciples of Hand), DoL (Disciples of Land)

Enter one or more job abbreviations (comma separated) or 'ALL': MIN, BTN

- Single level: 50
- Multiple levels: 50, 52, 55
- Level ranges: 50-54 (inclusive)
